```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```

**1. Based on the help file, how many rows and how many columns does the `datasaurus_dozen` file have? What are the variables included in the data frame? (this can be hardcoded)**
A data frame with 1846 rows and 3 columns. The variables included are;
a. dataset indicating which dataset the data are from
b. x: x-values
c. y: y-values

```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  count(dataset)
```

## Data visualization and summary
**2. Plot `y` vs. `x` for the `dino` dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between `x` and `y` for this dataset.**
```{r}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
**3. Plot `y` vs. `x` for the `star` dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between `x` and `y` for this dataset. How does this value compare to the `r` of `dino`?**


```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  count(dataset)
```
```{r}
star_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "star")

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = star_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
star_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
**4. Plot `y` vs. `x` for the `circle` dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between `x` and `y` for this dataset. How does this value compare to the `r` of `dino`?**

```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  count(dataset)
```
```{r}
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "circle")

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = circle_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
circle_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
**5. Finally, let's plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of facetting.**


```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  count(dataset)
```

```{r all-viz, eval=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

And we can use the `group_by` function to generate all correlation coefficients.
```{r first-10-r, eval=FALSE}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
- **Resize your figures:** 

Click on the gear icon in on top of the R Markdown document, and select "Output Options..." in the dropdown menu. In the pop up dialogue box go to the Figures tab and change the height and width of the figures, and hit OK when done. Then, knit your document and see how you like the new sizes. Change and knit again and again until you're happy with the figure sizes. Note that these values get saved in the YAML.

You can also use different figure sizes for different figures. To do so click on the gear icon within the chunk where you want to make a change. Changing the figure sizes added new options to these chunks: `fig.width` and `fig.height`. You can change them by defining different values directly in your R Markdown document as well.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
