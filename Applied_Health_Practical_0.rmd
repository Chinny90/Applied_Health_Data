```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```

**1. Based on the help file, how many rows and how many columns does the `datasaurus_dozen` file have? What are the variables included in the data frame? (this can be hardcoded)**

A data frame with 1846 rows and 3 columns. The variables included are;
a. dataset indicating which dataset the data are from
b. x: x-values
c. y: y-values

```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  count(dataset)
```

## Data visualization and summary
**2. Plot `y` vs. `x` for the `dino` dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between `x` and `y` for this dataset.**
```{r}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
**3. Plot `y` vs. `x` for the `star` dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between `x` and `y` for this dataset. How does this value compare to the `r` of `dino`?**


```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  count(dataset)
```
```{r}
star_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "star")

```

```{r star, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
ggplot(data = star_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
star_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
The r of "dino" is -0.06447185	while the r of "star" is -0.0629611	. The value of r of star is identical to r of dino in that for the both structures, there is a very weak inverse linear relationship between the variables x and y for both datasets. The correlation values does not entirely indicate that they are of different structures because the values are both negative, nearly the same and so close to zero (0). This would mean that the degree of linear relationship between x and y in both the dino and star dataset is almost identical.


**4. Plot `y` vs. `x` for the `circle` dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between `x` and `y` for this dataset. How does this value compare to the `r` of `dino`?**

```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  count(dataset)
```
```{r circle_dataset, fig.height=7, fig.width=9}
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "circle")

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = circle_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
circle_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
The r of "dino" is -0.06447185 while the r of "circle" is -0.06834336. For both datasets, the correlation coefficient are very close. The negative values which are close to zero (0) for both datasets indicates a very weak inverse linear relationship between the variables x and y for each dataset. Though the correlation coefficients are nearly similar, the visuals generated are different. Hence correlation does not sufficiently describe a data.

**5. Finally, let's plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of facetting.**


```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  count(dataset)
```

```{r all-viz, eval=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

** use the `group_by` function to generate all correlation coefficients.**

```{r first-10-r, eval=FALSE}
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
- **Resize your figures:** 

The dino, star and circle figures were reset.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
